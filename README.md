## Project Description

YESlingo is a translator application platform that provides users with translation capabilities across various mediums. It supports:
* **Text Translation**: Allows users to translate text into a specified language.
* **File Translation**: Enables users to upload files, extract text, and translate them.
* **Speech Translation**: Uses voice input to recognize and translate spoken language.

The application also includes:
* Translation **History** to track and manage previous translations.
* A **Chatbot** feature for users to practice and study language interactively.

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to log into the system with my username and password so that I can access personalized translation settings.
2. As a user, I want to translate text into a different language so that I can understand content written in a language I donâ€™t speak.
3. As a user, I want to upload a .txt file and have its content translated into my desired language so that I can easily understand text in languages I am unfamiliar with.
4. As a user, I want to be able to speak English and have my speech recognized as text, then translated into my desired different language.
5. As a user, I want my text translations to be automatically saved to history, and the history can be cleared if I want to.
6. As a user, I want to simulate real time conversation with a chatbot in specified input and output languages.
